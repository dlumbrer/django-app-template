# Contributions

There are many ways to contribute to this project:
* if you find an error, file an *issue* tagged as `bug`
* if you want an specific feature, file an *issue* tagged as `feature request`, even before submitting code
* if you want to submit code, fork the project and create a branch tagged according to the previously submitted *issue* and submit a *merge request*

Please, consider this as a *PoC*, and I am always open for improvements, so feel free to discuss about new funcionalities or ideas using project *issues*.

I hope it will someday part of [GrimoireLab](http://grimoirelab.github.io), but it will require a lot of work about:
* testing
* integration with existing deployment tools

Contributions are welcome!
