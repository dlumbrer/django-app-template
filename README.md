# Arthur django app

## Installation

Clone the repository and install, or check you already have, the requirements defined in the [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) file. They are mostly:

* Django
* django-rq

## Usage

Once you have the requirements installed (I recommend using a Python virtual environment) you can launch the web app using the command line:

```
django_arthur/django_arthur $ python3 manage.py migrate
django_arthur/django_arthur $ python3 manage.py runserver
```
